Overview of Customer Segmentation Using K-Means Clustering in Python

Objective:
The goal of this project is to segment customers into distinct groups based on shared characteristics and behaviors. This segmentation enables businesses to better understand their customer base, optimize marketing strategies, and provide personalized experiences.

1. Project Workflow

Step 1: Define the Problem
	•	Identify the purpose of segmentation (e.g., marketing campaigns, customer retention, product recommendations).
	•	Define the key variables for segmentation (e.g., purchase history, demographics, website activity).

Step 2: Data Collection
	•	Gather data from relevant sources like customer purchase records, survey responses, CRM systems, etc.
	•	Example data fields: Age, Gender, Income, Spending Score, Annual Spending.

Step 3: Data Preprocessing
	•	Handle missing values.
	•	Normalize/Standardize data to ensure uniformity.
	•	Encode categorical variables (if any).

Step 4: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Use visualization tools (e.g., seaborn, matplotlib) to explore trends and patterns.
	•	Check for correlations between variables.

Step 5: Implement K-Means Clustering
	•	Use the K-Means algorithm to group customers into clusters.
	•	Choose the optimal number of clusters using methods like the Elbow Method or Silhouette Score.

Step 6: Analyze and Interpret Results
	•	Evaluate the characteristics of each cluster.
	•	Use visualizations like scatter plots, heatmaps, and parallel coordinates to understand cluster behavior.

Step 7: Actionable Insights
	•	Propose strategies based on segmentation (e.g., targeted ads for high spenders, loyalty programs for regular customers).

Step 8: Deploy the Model
	•	Integrate the clustering model into business systems or dashboards (e.g., via Flask, Power BI).

2. Key Libraries
	•	Pandas: For data manipulation.
	•	NumPy: For numerical computations.
	•	Matplotlib/Seaborn: For data visualization.
	•	Scikit-learn: For implementing K-Means and evaluating clusters.
